| Pin |     | Function                             |
|-----|-----|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | VCC | Battery+ input                       |
| 2   | Kp  | Power control wire of the controller |
| 3   | GND | GND                                  |
| 4   | RX  | Data receive of the display          |
| 5   | TX  | Data transmit of the display         |

### Dependencies

VELOX relies on the following libraries:
- [megaTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore) - Arduino support for all tinyAVR 0/1/2-Series.
- [EEPROMWearLevel](https://github.com/PRosenb/EEPROMWearLevel) - EEPROMWearLevel bases on the EEPROM library included in the Arduino framework.
It reduces EEPROM wear by writing every new value to an other EEPROM location.
